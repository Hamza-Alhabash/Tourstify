# House Price Prediction Project

This project demonstrates the process of loading, exploring, and preprocessing data, training multiple models, evaluating their performance, and suggesting potential improvements for house price prediction.


## Introduction

This project uses various machine learning techniques to predict house prices. The dataset is split into training and test sets. We apply preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features. We then train multiple models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, and evaluate their performance.
